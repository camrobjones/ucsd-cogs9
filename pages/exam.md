<h1>Exam</h1>

The exam is an opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of lecture material. The best way to study for the exam is to carefully review your lecture notes, think about the main topics in the lectures, and then determine the details that support each of those topics. For example, we talk about reproducibility, and replicability. These are both major topics from one of the lectures. It is very likely that a question on the exam will be about this topic.  

{: .important }
The exam is closed-note and in-person. LLMs like ChatGPT have made it difficult to evaluate students in take-home exams while incentivizing learning. There will be other opportunities in the course to use LLMs to support learning the course (assignments, final project). 


To help students, since this is an intro class and we cover a **wide** range of topics, I make available a study guide to help you wrangle in all those key high level topics. It is up to you to flesh it out more, and fill in the details.

The exam will be held in class during week 10, not in finals week. The final exam slot will be used for the final project presentations.
