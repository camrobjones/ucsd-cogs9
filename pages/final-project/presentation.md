<h1>Final Presentation</h1>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

In the exam slot of the class, your team will give a 5 minute presentation to the rest of the class describing your final project. This is intended to be a celebration of your work and an opportunity to learn together as a class as much as it is an assessment. Each 5 minute presentation will be followed by a 5 minute Q&A where the rest of the class can ask questions about your project.

{: .warning }
Your whole group is required to be present in-person for the entire duration of the presentations: 3pm-6pm Friday 4th August.

There is no restriction on the format of your presentation, but you must include the following information:

- Your data science question
- Your hypothesis
- Some background information
- Ethical issues
- Your ideal and realistic datasets
- Your analysis plan
- Discussion of possible implications.

This is a lot to pack into 5 minutes! I have created an example [template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gqnNZogmF5n5hjLANlgyXJyQdjFWNWKMK88aRke1jK0/edit?usp=sharing) of a Google Slides presentation, including example slide timings. We will discuss in class in more detail how you can effectively manage time.

You will be assessed on the following criteria:

- Contains all required elements: 50%
- All team members contribute: 20%
- Effective slides: 10%
- Effective verbal communication: 10%
- Knowledgeable responses to questions: 10%
